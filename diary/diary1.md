<h1>first entry</h1>
i had to get an xray today, the person who was working the front desk gendered me correctly but my caregiver "corrected" them (they don't know) and that made me sad  
i also put a few death note episodes on my mp3 player (don't question how my mp3 player plays video it's not really an mp3 player)  
i'm also illegally downloading music so that's fun.
somehow my voice gave me euphoria lol
with love
