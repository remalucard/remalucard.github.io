<h1>second entry</h1>
i've decided to set this up in chapters and volumes. 10 entries per chapter and 10 chapters per volume. the code for it is strangely easy, just set each chapter as a parent and the volume as the grand-parent. another shoutout to just-the-docs for making this a piece of cake to do.  
not to mention it makes my life a whole lot easier so i can organise this.  
&nbsp;  
also [krunker.io](https://krunker.io) is a shocking amount of fun when bored
&nbsp;  
it appears that making custom css is hard as shit. css caches itself so i need to hard reload every time i change something. at least it's not that hard. i should document some of this so it's easier to see.

with love
